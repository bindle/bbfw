#   The `firewall_dir` option overrides the default directory used to store
#   firewall rules, ipset files, and pre/post hooks.  Uncomment the line below
#   to change the default location of the firewall rules.
# firewall_dir = @sysconfdir@/firewall.d    


#   The `quiet` option surpresses normal output of bbfw.  To enable quiet mode,
#   uncomment the line below and change the value to 'yes'.
# quiet = no


#   The `verbose` option enables verbose output for utilities which support
#   verbose flags (currently only iptables).  To enable verbose output,
#   uncomment the line below and change the value to 'yes'.
# verbose = no


#   Options which specify order of executions or loading of rules use the
#   following keywords:
#
#   global  - files within %{firewall_dir}/global.d/
#   apps    - files within %{firewall_dir}/apps.d/%{app}/
#   cluster - files within %{firewall_dir}/cluster.d/
#   local   - files within %{firewall_dir}/
#   none    - does nothing, can be used to disable feature
#
#   Types of files are always processed in the following order:
#
#   pre-hooks       (start and stop)
#   ipsets load     (start only)
#   iptables load   (start only)
#   iptables flush  (stop only / not user definable)
#   ipsets flush    (stop only / not user definable)
#   post-hooks      (start and stop)
#


#   The `order_prehook` option defines the order in which pre-hooks are
#   executed.  To modify the order in which pre-hooks are executed, uncomment
#   the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above for
#   keyword descriptions.
# order_prehook = global apps cluster local


#   The `order_posthook` option defines the order in which post-hooks are
#   executed.  To modify the order in which post-hooks are executed, uncomment
#   the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above for
#   keyword descriptions.
# order_posthook = global apps cluster local


#   The `order_ipsets` option defines the order in which ipsets are
#   loaded.  To modify the order in which ipsets are loaded, uncomment
#   the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above for
#   keyword descriptions.
# order_ipsets = global apps cluster local


#   The `order_iptables` option defines the order in which iptables
#   and ip6tables  are loaded.  To modify the order in which rules are loaded,
#   uncomment the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above
#   for keyword descriptions.
# order_iptables = apps local cluster global


#   The `order_sync` option defines the order in which firewall files are
#   synchronized.  To modify the order in which files are synchronized,
#   uncomment the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above
#   for keyword descriptions.  The 'local', 'builtin', and 'none' keywords are
#   ignored.
# order_sync = cluster apps global


#   The `sync_priority` option defines the order in which synchronization
#   methods take precedence.  Synchronization will be attempted for global,
#   cluster, and application directories.  The first method which is
#   configured on an individual directory will be used.  Configuring multiple
#   synchronization methods in the same directory are not supported.
#
#   Placing a file named `.sync_disabled` in the directory will disable
#   synchronization for an individual directory.
#
#   The following synchronization methods are supported:
#      git     - Use git to synchronize files.  Looks for %{dir}/.git
#      rsync   - Use rsync to synchronize files. Set URL in %{dir}/.rsync
#      script  - Use %{dir}/sync script to synchronize files.
#      none    - does nothing, can be used to disable synchronization
#
#   To modify the order of synchronization precedence, uncomment the line
#   below and modify the order of the key words.
# sync_priority = script git rsync


#   The `sync_timeout` option defines the synchronization timeout used for
#   the git and rsync methods.  To modify the synchronization timeout,
#   uncomment the line below and modify the value.
# sync_timeout = 60


#   The `sync_restarts` option determines wether the firewall is restarted if
#   a change is detected during synchronization.  A synchronization script
#   indicates that files were changed by returning an exit code of 2. To
#   disable restarting the firewall when changes are detected, uncomment the
#   line below and change the value to 'no'.
# sync_restarts = yes


#   The `sync_on_restart` option determines wether synchronization is
#   performed before the firewall is restarted. To disable synchronization
#   before restarting the firewall, uncomment the line below and change the
#   value to 'no'.
# sync_on_restart = yes


#   The `sync_on_start` option determines wether synchronization is
#   performed before the firewall is started. To disable synchronization before
#   starting the firewall, uncomment the line below and change the #   value to
#   'yes'.
# sync_on_start = no


# end of configuration
