#   The `firewall_dir` option overrides the default directory used to store
#   host specific network scripts and hooks.  Uncomment the line below to
#   change the default location of the network scripts.
# network_dir = @sysconfdir@/network.d    


#   The `quiet` option surpresses normal output of bbfw.  To enable quiet mode,
#   uncomment the line below and change the value to 'yes'.
# quiet = no


#   The `verbose` option enables verbose output for utilities which support
#   verbose flags (currently only iptables).  To enable verbose output,
#   uncomment the line below and change the value to 'yes'.
# verbose = yes


#   The `post_hook_script` option overrides the name of the psot-hook script
#   which is run after bringing the network interfaces up or down.  Uncomment
#   the line below to change the default post-hook name.
# post_hook_script = post-hook


#   Options which specify order of executions of network scripts and hooks use
#   the following keywords:
#
#   global  - files within %{network_dir}/global.d/
#   apps    - files within %{network_dir}/apps.d/%{app}/
#   cluster - files within %{network_dir}/cluster.d/
#   local   - files within %{network_dir}/
#   builtin - built-in routines


#   The `order_prehook` option defines the order in which pre-hooks are
#   executed.  To modify the order in which pre-hooks are executed, uncomment
#   the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above for
#   keyword descriptions.
# order_prehook = builtin global apps cluster local


#   The `order_posthook` option defines the order in which post-hooks are
#   executed.  To modify the order in which post-hooks are executed, uncomment
#   the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above for
#   keyword descriptions.
# order_posthook = builtin global apps cluster local


#   The `order_up` option defines the order in which network up scripts are
#   executed.  To modify the order in which post-hooks are executed, uncomment
#   the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above for
#   keyword descriptions.
# order_up = builtin global apps cluster local


#   The `order_down` option defines the order in which network down scripts
#   are executed.  To modify the order in which post-hooks are executed,
#   uncomment the line below and modify the order of the key words.  See above
#   for keyword descriptions.
# order_down = local cluster apps global builtin


# end of configuration
